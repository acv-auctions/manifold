Django Manifold's Documentation
================================

Manifold is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`__ application designed by
`ACV Auctions <https://acvauctions.com>`__ that allows for easy creation and serving of an RPC server through a
WSGI interface using `Gunicorn Thrift <https://github.com/eleme/gunicorn_thrift>`__. Manifold uses
`Apache Thrift <https://thrift.apache.org>`__ to standardize message transmission.
